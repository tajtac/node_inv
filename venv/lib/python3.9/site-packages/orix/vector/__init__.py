"""Three-dimensional quantities.

Vectors can represent positions in three-dimensional space and are also
commonly associated with motion, possessing both a magnitude and a
direction. In orix they are often encountered as derived objects such as
the rotation axis of a quaternion or the normal to the bounding planes
of a spherical region.
